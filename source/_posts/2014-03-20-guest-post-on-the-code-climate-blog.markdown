Head out to the Code Climate blog and read my guest post there called [Kickstart your next project with a Walking Skeleton](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2014/03/20/kickstart-your-next-project-with-a-walking-skeleton/). It's a about a technique I've used successfully that helps you validate the design of a system you are just starting to build. Lots of great posts there.

Many thanks to Frazer Horn and Susan Potter for reviewing an early draft of the post.
